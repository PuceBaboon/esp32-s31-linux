# ESP32-P4 HIL tester

This ESP-IDF application turns the Waveshare ESP32-P4-WIFI6-DEV-KIT into a
safe tester peer for ESP32-S31 Linux.  The CH343 UART0 console carries a
line-oriented `HIL1` JSON stream.  Tester GPIOs always boot as input/no-pull
and output commands require the per-boot token printed by `hil hello`; the
arm automatically expires after ten seconds.

The firmware performs these standalone checks without wiring an S31 board:

- P4 chip, dual HP cores, flash, heap, timer and safe GPIO state;
- P4-to-C6 ESP-Hosted-MCU SDIO readiness and coprocessor firmware version;
- a real C6 Wi-Fi scan without logging SSIDs;
- NimBLE HCI reset/synchronization through ESP-Hosted VHCI;
- UART RPC parsing and automatic output disarm.

The standalone self-test leaves every lane high-Z and reports electrical
loopback as `SKIP`; connected-board patterns require host-coordinated lane RPC.

For the four-lane SPI fixture, the tester uses GPSPI3 in slave-DMA mode and
enables the SCLK pad's input hysteresis. This is required to reject narrow
ringing-induced edges at the qualified 20 MHz modes-1/2 operating point. The
mode-1/2 transmit-edge override also works around the ESP-IDF 6.2 P4-v1.3
slave setting that otherwise fragments transactions. Modes 0/3 at 20 MHz are
a known P4 slave-fixture limitation and are not evidence against the S31
master; the all-mode fixture gate remains the 14 MHz request point.

Build with ESP-IDF 6.2 and the committed component versions.  The defaults
explicitly select pre-v3 ESP32-P4 support for the v1.3 chip fitted to this
board; do not force-flash an image configured for P4 revision 3.x:

```sh
source /path/to/esp-idf/export.sh
idf.py -B build-hil set-target esp32p4
idf.py -B build-hil build
idf.py -B build-hil -p /dev/serial/by-id/<P4-CH343> flash
```

Useful commands at 115200 baud:

```text

hil wifi-ap-report
hil wifi-ap-stop
hil gpio-read 20
hil gpio-input 20 none
hil lane-read 0
hil lane-input 0 none
hil arm <token-from-hello>
hil lane-write 0 1
hil gpio-write 20 1
hil gpio-wake 2 0 2000 500
hil disarm
```

`gpio-wake <gpio> <inactive-level> <delay-ms> <hold-ms>` provides a bounded
external wake stimulus for the S31 powered-suspend test. It first drives the
declared inactive level, switches to the opposite level after the delay, then
returns the pin to input/no-pull/high-Z after the hold time. The command accepts
only the tester's safe GPIO pool, requires the arm token, limits the delay to
250--8000 ms and the hold to 10--1000 ms, and remains subject to the ten-second
automatic disarm.

`wifi-ap-start` creates the HIL SoftAP through the onboard C6 and starts the
UDP echo service on `192.168.4.1:3334`. Use `-` as the password only for an
open-AP fault-isolation run. `wifi-ap-report` exposes active clients,
connect/disconnect events, packet and byte counts, input-pattern failures, and
echo failures. The normal WPA2 gate requires exactly 64 packets and 94208
bytes with both error counters at zero before `wifi-ap-stop` tears the fixture
down.

## Extended acceptance commands

`i2c-start [length] [scl-lane]` selects a 1–4096 byte register response
(default 16) and an optional SCL lane (default L0; L1 is reserved for SDA).
`i2c-report` includes the last received write length and CRC32, allowing an
independent comparison with `s31-hil-io i2c-long DEVICE LENGTH`.

`spi-master-start MODE LENGTH SPEED` drives the S31 SPI target after a
1500 ms receiver setup delay. It accepts modes 0–3, 1–4096 bytes and
10 kHz–5 MHz. The asynchronous `peer.spi-master-data` result checks every
received byte. Start the Linux target ioctl before this command. The Linux
`s31-hil-io spi DEVICE MODE SPEED LENGTH [BITS]` command accepts 8, 16 or
32-bit words and verifies the corresponding native-memory byte order.

Both bus commands require the current arm token. `peer-stop` releases their
resources and returns the fixture pins to high impedance.

`wifi-sta-echo-start SSID PASSWORD` connects the C6 to an S31 AP and starts
the UDP echo endpoint at `192.168.77.1:3334`; `-` selects an open network.
Configure the S31 AP address as `192.168.77.2/24`. Check
`wifi-sta-echo-report` for association, exact packet counts and zero errors,
then call `wifi-sta-echo-stop`.
